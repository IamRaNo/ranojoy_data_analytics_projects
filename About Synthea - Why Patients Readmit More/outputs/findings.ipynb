    "> ### 🏥 ***Encounter & Care Characteristics***\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`UrgentCare` and `Ambulatory` encounters** show the **highest readmission risk** compared to other encounter classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encounters lasting `more than 30 minutes`** are associated with a **significantly higher likelihood of readmission**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Higher utilization` levels** consistently correspond to **increased readmission risk**, indicating repeated or intensive care patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### 💊 ***Medication & Cost Factors***\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Short medication duration` (< 3 months)** is strongly associated with **higher readmission**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Lower total medication cost` (< 727)** shows a **higher readmission rate**, suggesting limited treatment exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Procedure costs above 1610`** are linked to **elevated readmission risk**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Very low (1–7) and very high (≥264) base medicine costs`** exhibit higher readmission compared to mid-range costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### 👥 ***Demographic & Socioeconomic Factors***\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Single` patients** experience **higher readmission rates** than other marital groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Black` and `Native` patients** show a **higher likelihood of readmission** relative to other racial groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Male` patients** have a **slightly higher readmission risk** than female patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encounters treated by **`female providers`** show **marginally higher readmission rates**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Age groups `19–50, 59–65,` and `80+`** demonstrate **elevated readmission risk**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Coverage ratios below 70%`** are associated with **higher readmission probability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Summary Insight\n",
    "> Readmission risk is primarily driven by encounter intensity and treatment continuity, while demographic and coverage factors play a secondary role.\n"
